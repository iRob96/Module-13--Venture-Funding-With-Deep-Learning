# Module-13--Venture-Funding-With-Deep-Learning

## Goal

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Your task is To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. You will do the following:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimize the model.

## Optimization

I attempted to optimze the first model by increasing the nodes and using 50 epochs. This slightly increased the accuracy each time.

On the second model I tried to optimize it by decreasing the nodes and using 100 epochs. This slightly decreased the accuracy each time.
